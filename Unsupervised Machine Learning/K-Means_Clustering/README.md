# K-Means Clusterring

unsupervised algorithms make inferences from datasets using only input vectors without referring to known, or labelled, outcomes. A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities. To process the learning data, the K-means algorithm in data mining starts with a first group of randomly selected centroids, which are used as the beginning points for every cluster, and then performs iterative (repetitive) calculations to optimize the positions of the centroids

## DATA SET

The link to the data set used in this K means Clustering example is provided below. In this assignment we will cover some K Means Clustering modeling with the data set "Fish".
