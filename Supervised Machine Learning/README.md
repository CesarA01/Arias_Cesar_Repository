# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is just a subcategory of machine learning and AI. This type of learning uses datasets to train algorithms in classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. The data sets that are inputed into supervised learning programs, help adjust weights until a model has been fitted. Supervised learning can be separated into two types of programs which are classification and regression. Classification uses algorithms to recognize specific qualities in data sets to conclude how they should be labeled of categorized as. While regression uses the information from the data sets in understanding the relationships between its dependent and independent variables.
