# Gradient Descent

![Descent](descent.png)

Gradient descent is a methods used in machine learning, to minimize any function by moving in the direction of the steepest slope. This type of method is used to update parameters in our models. These parameters we refer to are the doefficients in linear regression and wrights in neural networks.

## Data Set

In this example I created a model to use for gradient descent in the form of an equation.
