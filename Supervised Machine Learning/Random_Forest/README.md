# Random Forest

A random forest algorithm consists of many decision trees. The ‘forest’ generated by the random forest algorithm is trained through bagging or bootstrap aggregating. Bagging is an ensemble meta-algorithm that improves the accuracy of machine learning algorithms. The random forest algorithm establishes the outcome based on the predictions of the decision trees. It predicts by taking the average or mean of the output from various trees. Increasing the number of trees increases the precision of the outcome.
