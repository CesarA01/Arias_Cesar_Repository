# Logistc Regression

Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. This is another powerful supervised ML algorithm used for binary classification problems (when target is categorical).The best way to think about logistic regression is that it is a linear regression but for classification problems.
